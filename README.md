I'm a full-stack software engineer from Sydney currently living in Seattle and working at Palantir. I currently work on a frontend infrastructure team, building tooling to improve the experience of other frontend developers.

You can find a history of my personal projects here on GitHub.

Two of my favourite hobbies are baking and cooking. I keep a list of the recipes that I have baked and would like to bake, with any notes and additions on [Notion](https://recipes.johnwiseheart.me/).

You can contact me by email at johnwiseheart@gmail.com.
